### .NET4.0 targeted DLL

This folder contains a copy of the dll generated by the support team at [LabJack](https://labjack.com/). They made this upon our request, based on the discussions in issue #2 of this repository. 

The conversation with LabJack folks on their forum is [here](https://labjack.com/forums/t7/making-t-series-compatible-bonsai-rx).

Below is their instructions on how to set this up:

```
Attached is a .NET 4.0 targeted build of the LabJack.LJM.dll. 

Unzip for the dll. 

If needed, to install to the GAC, copy the dll to the LabJack\Drivers folder (default full path C:\Program Files (x86)\LabJack\Drivers), and run InstallLJNET.exe as administrator.

```
